# Reimann-zeroes-via-eigenvalues-of-2-by-2-matrix
This is a computational analysis project where we define a series of matrices, then find and analyze their eigenvalues which seem to have a surprising correspondence to non-trivial zeroes of the Reimann Zeta function.

To begin with, define a list $P=(2,3,5,7,11,13,17...)$ of all prime numbers arranged in ascending order.
Next we define our matrix $$M_i=
\left[
\begin{array}{ll}
    1 & 1  \\
    1 & -1 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$
