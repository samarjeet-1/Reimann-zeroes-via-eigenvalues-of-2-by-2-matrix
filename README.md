# Reimann-zeroes-via-eigenvalues-of-2-by-2-matrix
This is a computational analysis project where we define a series of matrices, then find and analyze their eigenvalues which seem to have a surprising correspondence to non-trivial zeroes of the Reimann Zeta function.

About this project:-
I started this project around mid 2020 after I was inspired from a video by Grant Sanderson on Riemann zeta function on his youtube channel 3Blue1Brown. This initally started out as a fun project during the covid pandemic but soon it turned into a serious research effort as I spent the next two years trying to learn about topics like number theory, complex analysis and matrix analysis from whatever free resources I could get online. I have taken all the meaningful and complete results I could get and combined them with a few mathmatical proofs into a research paper which I have attached here. I hope this paper will be useful for further mathematical research on this topic which I could't do due to my limited advanced math knowledge. 

Technical Details:-
1. Download a precomputed list of imaginary part of Riemann zeroes and put its path in the zzarray
2. Most of the code and results are in main code.py but the number of zeroes as fucntion of epsilon is in growth of apparent zeroes with value of epsilon.py
